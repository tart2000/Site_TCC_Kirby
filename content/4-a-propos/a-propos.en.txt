###Mission

Techno Culture Club (TCC) is a non-profit organization which fosters active community participation in culture by supporting the development of new practices and uses of technology in the cultural sector.

We facilitate creative technology activities, support professionals with training and resources, engage users in digital media and fabrication labs, produce technology-discovery fairs and creative sprints, and design and implement novel participatory and cultural experiences.

During this moment of effervescence for digital culture, we practice experimentation, collaboration and creative uses of technologies to support a community-centred development of the cultural sector. Through our activities, we continue to engage critically with technology’s expanding role in culture and society. Our mantra is *people re-make institutions* – our actions nurture the active participation, connectedness, understanding, and agency of communities in these spaces.

###Areas of interest & action :

- cultural spaces (museums, libraries, etc.)
- digital justice
- education and learning
- the city and urban spaces
- new media and new forms of storytelling

###History
Techno Culture Club was born following the first edition of Museomix in Montreal. The participants, as well as the even organizers, were all seduced by the energy of Museomix. They were seeking more occasions to meet and collaborate on projects.
