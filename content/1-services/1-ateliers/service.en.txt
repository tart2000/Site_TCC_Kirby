Short: Fun + hands-on workshops with a creative-challenge as a means to learn emergent technologies.

Text:

ATELIERS is a series of creative-challenge style workshops on emergent technologies and practices. The ultimate goal is to promote techno-cultural literacy and collaboration.

We will lean on the public fascination with emergent technologies, such as 3D printing, as a means for providing techno-cultural literacy. Activities will complement creativity and collaboration with technical learning to appeal to non-geeks. We will host workshops and practice sessions in various Montreal neighbourhoods.
