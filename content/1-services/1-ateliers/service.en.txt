Short: Creative, hands-on workshops on emergent and digital technologies.

Text :

We design and facilitate creative workshops around emergent technologies for cultural and educational institutions, and more generally, for anyone interested in learning (3D printing, virtual reality, digital fabrication, ...). Experimentation, active learning, and fun all values central to our workshop design, be they in our creative space or elsewhere (libraries, schools, ...). We systematically evaluate our workshops with participant feedback to continue learning from their experiences.
