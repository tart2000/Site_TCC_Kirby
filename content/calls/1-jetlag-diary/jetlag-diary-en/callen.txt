**Lazy reader ? ** all you have to know is : 2 almost-free plane tickets to Mexico for a week - almost because you'll have a mission to accomplish. That got your attention ? Read more here : 

direct link to the application form : http://goo.gl/forms/DTdxTS0ic6 
Deadline for applications : September 11th 2015

**why ?**
Museomix is going even more global! In order to illustrate our new partnership with Mexico, we propose a very peculiar side project : THE JETLAG DIARY - a cross-cultural storytelling experiment. The idea is to discover new ways, but also trigger new collaborations within the technocultural field.

**What ?**
This experiment will take the form of a blog where two teams of reporters will switch country for a week. Their main objective will be to document their daily cultural experiences abroad, both during a mandatory participation in the local Museomix and during the following days while they discover the cultural offer of the city. 

**How ?**
For seven days, both teams will have to publish a post every day at the same time on one designated blog. They will have to follow a set of rules that will be designed in order to frame the project and guide their journey abroad and answer specific questions. 

**Who ?**
The two teams of reporters will be selected through an open call to participant in both cities - the winners will be announced on September 16th. We are seeking anybody able to illustrate or report about this cross-cultural experiment (illustrator, videast, blogger, graphic designer, photographer and/or reporter, journalist, etc.)

**How is this possible ? **
Thanks to the partnership with the Ministry of foreign affairs of Québec and the Groupe de Travail Québec-Mexique, we are able to offer 2 plane tickets for a week of reporting in Mexico City. The housing accommodation will be provided by the local Museomix teams.
