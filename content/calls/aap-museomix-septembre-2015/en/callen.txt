Are you motivated and creative? How’d you like to lock yourself up for the weekend at the Musée d’art Contemporain de Montréal? We are pleased to announce our call for participants in the 2015 edition of MuseomixMTL.

An authentic technocultural laboratory, Museomix is looking for devotees of digital technologies, culture and museology to explore and develop prototypes that propose new ways of understanding digital technologies at the museum.

Teams will be formed consisting of six members, one from each of the seven profiles below:

- ** INTERACTION & USAGE (UX/UI)**
You are a user-experience specialist, an interface designer, an interactive designer or an information architect. You navigate a website like a ship navigates the ocean. You have more than 10 avatars. You know everyone at Ubisoft.

- **COMMUNICATION & DIFFUSION**
You are a communication strategist, a social media specialist, a community manager or a blogger. You love to provoke reactions and initiate interactions on the Web. You have 22K Twitter followers.

- ** PRODUCTION / MAKING**
You are a handyman (or handywoman), a maker. We would call on you as much to install a lamp as to build a bridge. You handle a drill like Lucky Luke handles a gun. You adore the smell of sawdust.

- **CODING & DEVELOPMENT**
You write a line of code like you write your grocery list. You create algorithms in your sleep. Your mother tongue is HTML, CSS, XML, Java and C++.

- **CONTENT & CULTURAL MEDIATION EXPERTISE**
Your nose is constantly in history books or archives. You could spend an all-nighter analyzing an art work consisting of a white square on a white canvas. To you, writing texts isn’t drudgery, it’s a game.

- **GRAPHIC DESIGN & LAYOUT**
The latest edition of Pica is your bedside reading. Your pen is an extension of your artm. You never sleep the night before the winners of Grafika are announced. You always carry a Pantone chart in your purse/backpack.

- ** SPATIAL DESIGN & PLANNING**
You live more in SketchUp than in real life. You are constantly window-shopping for new ideas. You take notes when you go to museums rather than looking at the sculptures.

**SELECTION PROCESS :**
Our panel of professionals from the cultural and new technologies sectors will make its selection based on the innovative character, creativity and motivation of the Museomixer.

Fill in the form and send us your application. The results will be revealed mid-October!

**REMINDER :**
- **A Participation Fee of $100 is required to confirm your presence. **This fee covers meals during the event.
- Museomix is a creative sprint with an intense pace. ** Your participation requires your presence during all 3 days of the event.**
