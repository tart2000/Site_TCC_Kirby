###Context of the co-residency (summary)
Are you an artist, programmer, or maker and would you be interested in creating new technological experiences for libraries visitors? If so, this co-residency is made for you! (Also, if you long for another Mus√©omix, then this residency is definitely made for you!)

This summer, Techno Culture Club, in partnership with the City of Laval, is offering three team co-residencies, **in the Studio, the medialab of the Multicultural Library of Laval**. The residencies last **one month, in July or August 2018**, and conclude with a **public presentation on September 13th, 2018**.
Candidates will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. You have until June 15th (for the July residency) or July 6th (for the August residency) to submit your application to participate using the [online application form available at this link](https://goo.gl/forms/JhwCQLb8GalxoA3L2).

###Objective
Each residency will focus on creating a digital experience kit. Like a book, the digital experience kit is an object that users will borrow for free from the library and which invites users to participate in a cultural experience. The kit consists of:
1. A technological component (a micro-computer, accessory components, and related software), and
2. A guide on how to use the kit.

  - **collaboration in a multidisciplinary team** : artist & maker or programmer
  - **support from staff** of Techno Culture Club and of the Studio
  - access to technological and audio-visual equipment at the Studio
  - moments of audience interaction and testing

  - in collaboration with TCC, a minimal visual (video or photo and text) journalling of the co-creative process
  - user guide

- *Compensation* for the residency and assignment of rights: **$1000 per participant** (as per the CQAM Media Arts Fee Schedule)
