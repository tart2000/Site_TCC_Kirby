Techno Culture club was born to create, support, share, and organize awesome and memorable projects at the intersection of culture and techonology. Each project is carefully studied and then orchestrated and led by members of the community. Some projects are Montreal editions of international events, others are signature events imagined specially by Techno Culture Club
*Oh yeah! We are always ready to collaborate on new extraordinary projects!*
