ABC3D Camp is a series of pop-up, creative-challenge, 3D printing workshops. The ultimate goal is to promote techno-cultural literacy and collaboration. Hosted open-print sessions will complement the workshops by seeding communities of practice.

We will lean on the public fascination with 3D printing as a means for providing techno-cultural literacy. Activities will complement creativity and collaboration with technical learning to appeal to non-geeks. We will host workshops and practice sessions in various Montreal neighbourhoods.
